In the context of emotions in text, valence represents the positivity or negativity of the emotion expressed. For example, words like ""happy,"" ""joyful,"" or ""excited"" have positive valence, whereas words like ""sad,"" ""angry,"" or ""frustrated"" have negative valence.
It essentially measures the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness of the emotion.              

Arousal indicates the level of alertness, excitement, or energy associated with an emotion. It ranges from high arousal (e.g., excitement, anger) to low arousal (e.g., calm, boredom). In text, high-arousal words might include ""thrilled,"" ""furious,"" or ""ecstatic,"" while low-arousal words could be ""relaxed,"" ""content,"" or ""lethargic.""
This dimension measures how stimulating or soothing the emotional state is.

Dominance reflects the degree of control, influence, or power that one feels in a particular emotional state. High dominance implies feelings of control and empowerment, while low dominance suggests feelings of submissiveness or lack of control. In text, emotions like ""confident,"" ""powerful,"" or ""authoritative"" would have high dominance, whereas ""helpless,"" ""weak,"" or ""submissive"" would have low dominance.

In the context of emotions in text, valence represents the positivity or negativity of the emotion expressed. For example, words like ""happy,"" ""joyful,"" or ""excited"" have positive valence, whereas words like ""sad,"" ""angry,"" or ""frustrated"" have negative valence.
It essentially measures the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness of the emotion.              

Arousal indicates the level of alertness, excitement, or energy associated with an emotion. It ranges from high arousal (e.g., excitement, anger) to low arousal (e.g., calm, boredom). In text, high-arousal words might include ""thrilled,"" ""furious,"" or ""ecstatic,"" while low-arousal words could be ""relaxed,"" ""content,"" or ""lethargic.""
This dimension measures how stimulating or soothing the emotional state is.

Dominance reflects the degree of control, influence, or power that one feels in a particular emotional state. High dominance implies feelings of control and empowerment, while low dominance suggests feelings of submissiveness or lack of control.
